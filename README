COBRA version 0.01a pre-Alpha release

COBRA is the Cache Optimal Bit-Reverse Algorithm.  This release is an
implementation of the algorithm.  There are two papers published on
the actual algorithm and some of it's performance numbers (see bottom
of this file for references).  

This distribution comes with the following six files:

README - This file.

Makefile - The file used to make the bit-reverse object file and an
example code.

gen.c - Configures the bit-reversal implementation for the particular
machine you are running on.

_bitrev.h - The .h file for COBRA.  Will be renamed to "bitrev.h"
during the execution of the generator.

bitrev.c - Contains the actual COBRA algorithm.  This code performs
bit-reversals on type 'float'.  

example.c - An example code that shows how to use the COBRA algorithm.

To make the bitrev.o file, in the directory this distribution is
located type:
make bitrev.o

You will be prompted with two questions:
"What is the size of cache (in Kbytes)?"
"How many bytes are there in a cache line?"

Answer these questions as dictated by your machine.  

To make the example program, in the directory this distribution is
located type:
make example

You will be prompted with the same above questions (unless you've
already made the bitrev.o file).  The executable takes one command
line parameter 'lgn' which is the log of the bit-reverse this example
will do.  

Any questions or comments should be directed to: kangsu@alumni.ucsd.edu
